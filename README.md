# Calculator System

## Overview

This project is a calculator system designed to read equations from an input file, validate their syntax, convert valid equations from infix to prefix notation, evaluate the prefix expressions, and provide outputs accordingly. The input file contains an unspecified number of equations written in infix form.

## Features

1. **Read Equations from File:** The program reads equations from an input file provided by the user.
2. **Validate Equations:** The system checks the validity of equations, determining whether they are syntactically correct. It provides detailed output specifying the validity status of each equation.
3. **Convert to Prefix Notation:** Valid equations are converted from infix to prefix notation.
4. **Evaluate Prefix Expressions:** The system evaluates the prefix expressions and prints the results of each equation on a separate line.
5. **Print Invalid Equations:** Invalid equations are printed, indicating the issues found in their syntax.
6. **Output to File:** All equations are printed to an output file (`output.txt`), indicating their validity. For valid equations, the prefix expression and its result are also printed.
7. **Exit:** The program can be exited at any time.

## Implementation Details

In this assignment, the following tasks are implemented:

1. Reading the input file containing equations.
2. Validating the syntax of equations and providing detailed output.
3. Converting valid equations from infix to prefix notation.
4. Evaluating prefix expressions and printing results.
5. Handling and printing invalid equations.
6. Writing all equations, along with their validation status, prefix expressions, and results (if valid), to an output file.
7. Providing an option to exit the program.

The implementation follows a modular structure to ensure clarity, readability, and maintainability. It utilizes appropriate data structures and algorithms for parsing equations, validating syntax, converting notation, and evaluating expressions.
